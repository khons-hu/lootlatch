# Khonstash

A small Steam item watchlist. Check prices, keep your reasoning next to an item, and see what remains after fees.

Deployment is prepared for Vercel. The public URL will be added after deployment is verified.

## What it does

- Up to 12 CS2, Dota 2, TF2 or Rust items, with quantities, cost and a buy-price target.
- Manual EUR price checks through Steam's public price overview endpoint. No Steam login or API key.
- An in-app notice when a checked price meets your target. No background polling or closed-app push.
- Up to 60 observations per item, starting with your own checks. Manual price entry when Steam is unavailable.
- Estimated wallet proceeds, break-even price, notes and JSON backup/restore.
- Light/dark mode, keyboard controls, mobile layout and no animation loops.

Prices are lowest listings, not guaranteed sale prices. The undocumented endpoint can change or rate-limit requests. Quotes are cached for up to 10 minutes. Instance-local throttling is a best-effort limit, not a global distributed quota. No proxies or authenticated Steam sessions are used.

The fee calculator estimates 5% Steam + 10% game fees in EUR cents. Confirm the actual amount in Steam's sell dialog. Steam Wallet proceeds cannot be withdrawn as cash. [Steam Market FAQ](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/61F0-72B7-9A18-C70B).

## Run

Node.js 20 or later, no dependencies:

```sh
npm test
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4176. `npm run build` copies the frontend into `dist`. Vercel serves `api/price.js` as a function, with the Other framework preset and the settings in `vercel.json`.

No paid API, database, model calls or account system. Hosting is subject to your host's free-tier limits. Browser data is not synced. Export a backup before clearing site data.

## Privacy and scope

Watchlists, cost and notes stay in localStorage. A price check sends only the game's app ID and item name to this app's server, which requests a public EUR quote from Steam. Hosting providers may retain ordinary request logs. No analytics or tracking SDKs.

This app does not trade, connect a wallet, boost hours or automate Steam gameplay. Independent project, not affiliated with Valve.

## License

Original project code is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE), copyright © 2026 Patrick Obrtal. Third-party components retain their own licenses.

The interface supports English, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, German, Spanish and Czech. The native language selector saves its choice in this browser, otherwise the app uses the first supported browser language and falls back to English. Language changes preserve saved items, notes and editor values. Dates, numbers and EUR values follow the selected locale. Steam item/game names and personal notes remain unchanged.

Translations live in `public/messages.js`. `public/i18n.js` translates explicitly marked static labels and authored template segments before inserting source values. It does not translate arbitrary page content or call an external translation service. API and validation errors are mapped locally, with a localized fallback for unknown errors. Price checks remain manual, with no background monitoring or notifications while the app is closed.
